      <h2>Why Books Matter to Me</h2>
      <p>
        I began reading in 2011 in Bangladesh, sharing library novels with friends between classes. Those quiet
        minutes grew into a lifelong habit that trained my attention, broadened my perspective, and taught me to
        enjoy stillness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years I’ve read ~140 books in Bengali and 70+ in English. In 2018 I discovered non-fiction; in 2019,
        <em>Who Moved My Cheese?</em> reframed how I deal with change. Today, books remain my compass for learning,
        resilience, and empathy.
      </p>

            <h2>What Reading Taught Me</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep focus:</strong> long-form reading strengthened my attention span and patience.</li>
                <li><strong>Systems thinking:</strong> non-fiction and tech books improved my problem-solving flows.</li>
                <li><strong>Clarity & empathy:</strong> stories sharpen how I communicate with users and teammates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Where This Leads</h2>
            <p>
                I’m building <strong>Bookface</strong> — a social reading app where a book only “counts” after a public review.
                It encourages thoughtful reading, accountability, and community. I’m also launching
                <strong>Mahfuza’s Reading Journal</strong> to document notes and reviews as I continue learning.
